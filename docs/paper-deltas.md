## A. Software versions (§II-B)

| # | Status | Paper says | Artifact uses | Suggested text |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | ADD | — (no Rust library named) | `arrow` / `parquet` crates **53.4.1** (all 13 arrow/parquet crates locked to 53.4.1) | "…reads Parquet via the Apache Arrow Rust implementation (`arrow`/`parquet` crates 53.4.1)…" |
| A2 | ADD | — (no JVM library named) | parquet-java (`parquet-hadoop`) **1.14.4**, `hadoop-client-api`/`hadoop-client-runtime` **3.3.6** (shaded), `slf4j-nop` 2.0.16 | "…reads Parquet via parquet-java 1.14.4 with `LocalInputFile`; Hadoop 3.3.6 shaded client jars supply configuration classes only…" |
| A3 | OK | rustc 1.81.0, `--release`, `opt-level = 3` | same, **plus** `lto = "fat"`, `codegen-units = 1`, `panic = "abort"` | add the three extra profile settings |

| A5 | ADD | — | base images pinned by digest (see `docker/*.Dockerfile`) | one sentence + artifact DOI |

## B. Configurations (§II-B)

| # | Status | Paper says | Artifact uses | Suggested text |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| B1 | MUST | `-XX:+UseZGC` | `-XX:+UseZGC -XX:+ZGenerational` (generational ZGC; on JDK 21 the flag is required, otherwise single-generation ZGC runs) | "…the generational Z Garbage Collector (`-XX:+UseZGC -XX:+ZGenerational`)…" |
| B2 | ADD | two GC variants (ZGC, G1) | **three**: G1, generational ZGC, **ParallelGC** (`-XX:+UseParallelGC`, throughput-oriented reference) | add ParallelGC as a third sub-variant |
| B3 | ADD | one Rust variant | **two**: system allocator (glibc malloc) and **mimalloc** 0.1.43 | "…benchmarked with the system allocator and with mimalloc, to separate allocator cost from GC cost." |
| B4 | ADD | `-Xms3G -Xmx3G` | plus `-XX:+AlwaysPreTouch` on all JVM runs; JFR (`profiling/gc.jfc`) and `-Xlog:gc*` enabled | list all JVM flags in a table |
| B5 | ADD | — | one extra **NMT run** per JVM config (`-XX:NativeMemoryTracking=summary`), excluded from timing | describe as memory-accounting run |
| B6 | **MUST** | — | **Heap-size sweep (core GC-tax result; Hertz & Berger, OOPSLA 2005 methodology).** (0) Per collector, measure the off-heap reserve: one NMT run at a 3,072 MiB heap on the sweep preset; reserve_c = max(512, ⌈1.5 × non-heap committed / 64⌉ × 64) MiB; heap cap_c = 4,096 − reserve_c (measured values reported in the H_min table). (1) Binary-search H_min = smallest `-Xms=-Xmx` (128 MiB granularity) at which the small preset completes; a probe passes only if 3/3 attempts succeed; probes use exactly the sweep's JVM flags, JFR included. (2) Run each collector at 1.25×, 1.5×, 2×, 3×, 4× its own H_min, skipping points above cap_c (reported with the reason). **No `-XX:+AlwaysPreTouch`**, so resident memory reflects use. (3) N = 10 measured runs per point plus 1 warm-up; failures are counted, not retried, and reported as completed/total (e.g. 9/10 at 1.25×); record CPU-seconds, wall, M_peak, GC pause percentiles, total pause time and total GC-cycle time (JFR). (4) Rust (both allocators) as flat reference lines measured in the same session. Figures: CPU-seconds vs heap multiple; M_peak vs heap multiple. | new subsection in Methodology + Results; cite Hertz & Berger 2005 |
| B7 | **MUST** | `-Xms3G -Xmx3G` described as *the* JVM configuration | the fixed `-Xms3G -Xmx3G -XX:+AlwaysPreTouch` configuration is retained and labelled **"production-style"** (capacity-planned service); its M_peak reflects the setting, not the need. The heap sweep (B6) measures the need. | rename it "production-style" wherever it appears |

## C. Dataset (§II-C)

| # | Status | Paper says | Artifact uses | Suggested text |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | **MUST** | "1-Terabyte … containing 1.2 billion rows" | full preset = **950,000,000 rows ≈ 1.007 TB** (≈1,060 bytes/row on disk); 1.2 B rows would be ≈ 1.27 TB | "…a synthetic, uncompressed ≈1.0 TB dataset of 950 million rows…" |
| C2 | ADD | schema `{id: UUID, ts: Int64, payload: String(1024), metric: Float64}` | id = FixedSizeBinary(16) UUIDv4; ts = epoch-ms uniform over 30 days from 2024-01-01; payload = exactly 1024 chars from `[A-Za-z0-9_-]`; metric ~ Normal(100, 25) clamped ≥ 0; all columns REQUIRED | give the distributions |
| C3 | ADD | — | **row groups of 65,536 rows (~69 MB)**, 64 files | "Row groups hold 65,536 rows (≈69 MB) so that four concurrent row groups fit well within the 4 GB envelope." |
| C4 | ADD | "uncompressed" | UNCOMPRESSED, dictionary **disabled**, PLAIN encoding, data page v1 | state all three |
| C5 | ADD | — | deterministic generator (ChaCha8, seed 42, one stream per file); byte-identical regeneration | reproducibility sentence |

| C6 | **MUST** | one dataset for everything | **Preset plan:** heap sweep on the **small** preset (10 M rows, ≈10.6 GB); H_min validated on the **full** preset (per collector, 3 attempts at the small-preset H_min and at ⌈1.25 × H_min⌉); production-style comparison on the **full** preset (950 M rows, ≈1.0 TB). | "Because the workload streams with bounded state (720 hourly groups; four row groups in flight), the minimum heap should not depend on dataset size. We determine H_min on a 10 M-row dataset and verify it on the full 950 M-row dataset [result: agree / disagree]." Report a disagreement if it occurs. |

## D. Workload (paper has no workload section yet — §IV)

| # | Status | Content |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | **MUST** | Exact steps, identical in both languages, per (file, row group) unit, in batches of **8,192 rows**: (1) materialize each row into an owned language-native record (Rust `struct` with owned `String`; Scala `case class`); (2) filter `metric > 75.0`; (3) transform: `hour_bucket = ts / 3,600,000`, `payload_hash = FNV-1a-64(payload)`, `tag = upper(payload[0..8])`; (4) aggregate by `hour_bucket`: count, sum, min, max of `metric`, and XOR of `payload_hash ⊕ FNV-1a-64(tag) ⊕ id_lo ⊕ id_hi`; (5) write the 720 hourly aggregates, sorted, to one Parquet file and `fsync`. |
| D2 | ADD | Parallelism: 4 workers pull (file, row group) units from a shared counter (Rust: `std::thread::scope`; Scala: `Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4)`). |
| D3 | ADD | Correctness: both pipelines produce **bit-identical** aggregates (partials merged in unit order), verified on the dev (1 M rows) and small (10 M rows) presets for all five configurations. |
| D4 | **MUST** | Latency metrics. **Primary: per-unit latency** = time to process one full 65,536-row row-group unit = unit setup (open file, read footer, prepare/load the row group) + all of its 8,192-row batches. The scope is identical in both languages. (Each file's last, shorter row group is excluded.) **Secondary: per-batch latency** = time to process one 8,192-row batch (decode + materialize + filter + transform + aggregate), excluding setup. It is asymmetric: parquet-java's `readRowGroup` reads the row group during setup, while arrow-rs reads pages lazily inside batches, so Rust's I/O is inside batch latency and Scala's is not. Report p50/p95/p99/p99.9 with cluster-bootstrap CIs (resampling whole runs). |

## E. Measurement (§II-D)

| # | Status | Paper says | Artifact does | Suggested text |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | **MUST** | M_peak = max RSS(t) | cgroup v2 `memory.peak` includes page cache, which a streaming read fills to the limit for every configuration. **M_peak = max over 10 Hz samples of `memory.stat anon + shmem`.** `shmem` must be included: ZGC backs the Java heap with memfd shared memory, which the kernel accounts as `shmem` (inside `file`), not `anon` — `anon` alone under-reports ZGC by the full heap size (≈3 GB). Page cache (`file − shmem`), `memory.current` and `memory.peak` are reported separately. | "M_peak is the peak private memory of the container cgroup, `anon + shmem`, sampled at 10 Hz; page cache is excluded and reported separately. Shared memory is included because ZGC maps its heap through memfd." |
| E2 | **MUST** | "using a detached native eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) host profiler" | host-side sampler reading cgroup v2 `memory.stat`/`cpu.stat` (plus `memory.current`, `memory.peak`) at 10 Hz; final totals captured in-container at exit. **No eBPF is used.** | replace "a detached native eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) host profiler" with "cgroup v2 `memory.stat`/`cpu.stat` counters sampled at 10 Hz" |
| E3 | ADD | E_compute integral of CPU utilization | `cpu.stat usage_usec` of the container cgroup at exit (exact kernel accounting, equals the integral) | note equivalence |
| E3b | ADD | "execution lifetime … from the initial file descriptor read to the final durable disk synchronization" | wall time = pipeline process start → exit inside the container (includes JVM startup), measured with `/proc/uptime` (not stepped by NTP; 10 ms resolution); the pipeline's own main → output `fsync` time is also recorded | state both and which one tables use (`wall_ns`) |
| E4 | ADD | GC pauses via JFR | `jdk.GCPhasePause` (pause distribution, total pause time) + `jdk.GarbageCollection` (GC count; total GC-cycle time = sum of cycle durations, wall time incl. concurrent phases) + `jdk.GCHeapSummary` (heap used/committed), parsed with `jfr print --json`; ZGC's cost appears mainly as concurrent CPU, not pauses | mention the event types, both totals, and the ZGC caveat |
| E5 | ADD | cost from vCPU-hours | both **provisioned** (4 vCPU × wall time — what clouds bill) and **consumed** (`usage_usec`) vCPU-hours; rates from a user-supplied YAML (no hardcoded prices) | report both |
| E6 | ADD | — | protocol: page cache dropped before every run; 2 discarded JVM warm-up runs on the small preset; N = 10 measured runs per config in randomized order | add a "Protocol" paragraph |
| E7 | ADD | — | statistics: mean ± 95 % CI (t), Mann–Whitney U with Cliff's δ, cluster-bootstrap CIs (resampling runs) for p99/p99.9; a quantile q is reported only with ≥ 10/(1−q) samples (p99 ≥ 1,000; p99.9 ≥ 10,000) — on the small preset (≈1,520 full units over 10 runs) per-unit p99.9 is therefore not reported; the full preset (≈14,500 units/run) supports it | add a "Statistical treatment" paragraph |

## F. Framing (Abstract, §I, §II)

| # | Status | Issue |
|---|---|---|
| F1 | WORDING | Abstract states results ("eliminates long-tail p99 latency spikes", "reduces overall cloud infrastructure costs") before measurements exist; restate as hypotheses until data supports them. |
| F2 | MUST | §I roadmap says §II = related work, §III = setup; the draft's §II is the setup and there is no related-work section. |
| F3 | WORDING | "airtight", "peer-reviewed evaluation", "exact GC tax", "completely eliminating" — soften. |
| F4 | WORDING | Title/scope: single node, 4 vCPU, no distributed shuffle; scope the claim to per-executor runtime cost. |
| F5 | ADD | Threats to validity: arrow-rs vs parquet-java library differences (eager row-group load vs lazy page reads, per-value `Binary` objects); hash-map idiom (SipHash `HashMap` vs `LongMap`); heap sizing fixes JVM footprint; JIT warm-up included in wall time. |
